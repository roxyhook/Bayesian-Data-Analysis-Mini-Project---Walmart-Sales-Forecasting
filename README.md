The aim of this project is to analyze Walmartâ€™s weekly sales performance and identify key factors that influence sales across different stores. By applying and comparing Bayesian Linear Regression and Bayesian Logistic Regression models, the study evaluates how predictors such as holidays, fuel price, temperature, CPI, and unemployment impact sales. The goal is to determine the best-fitting model for accurate sales forecasting and provide insights that can support strategic decision-making and operational efficiency in retail.
